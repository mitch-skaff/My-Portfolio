            <h2>About me</h2>
            <div> 
                <p>
                    Born and raised in Jacksonville, Fl. Graduated from The University of Florida with a bachelors in Economics. Shortly after graduating I began my career at a FinTech company, SS&C Technologies,
                    where I was a portfolio/data analyst. In this role I began to work deeply with our Custom Engineering team and became fascinated with the endless possibilities! After soon realizing this was the field for me, I enrolled in the UCF Coding Bootcamp in early 2021 and began my engineering career. Below you will see several of the key projects I have 
                    worked on to this point.

                    On a more personal note, some of my favorite hobbies include playing sports, lifting weights, traveling, and finding good food! I'm also a highly motivated individual 
                    who is consistently looking to not only progress my career but to also learn as much as possible along the way.
